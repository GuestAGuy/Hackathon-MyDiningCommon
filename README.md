# Hackathon-project-2

Inspiration
It is always a hassle to open up the Davis DC website to check for the food menu, so we create an android app

What it does
it shows the menu of the food that serves in the Dinning Common of that day

How we built it
We built it with Android studio

Challenges we ran into
we have no experience of android app development at all before this, so we faced many bugs and issues during the coding process, and we have learn from scratch

Accomplishments that we're proud of
we managed to complete the app in time, and we made used web scraping tool to get the information from the Segundo website.

What we learned
android app development

What's next for Davis DC food menu app
more feature like food for other DC, notification for your favorited foods, rating system for foods, better UI and nutrition information.
